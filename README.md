# Open TGM
A free and open source clone of the TGM series.
For the moment, only a TGM1 and TAP implementation is planned.

In the long term, an online multiplayer feature should be available for VS mode and Doubles. (Won't be available on all ports of the game)

Working ports:
- Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

Work in progress ports:
- GameBoy Advance
- PlayStation Portable
- 3DS

Planned ports: (not necessarily implemented in this order)
- Nintendo DS
- GameCube
- Wii
- Switch
- PlayStation 1
- PlayStation 2
- PlayStation 3
- Original Xbox
- Xbox 360
- Xbox One
- Saturn
- Dreamcast

Possible ports if the target hardware is powerful enough: (needs some testing)
- Neo-Geo
- Sega Mega Drive / Genesis

Due to the lack of a C++ compiler for the Super Nintendo / Super Famicom, porting to it is currently impossible.
