# Modes

Each mode is defined with by it's .cpp and .h file.

To add a new mode, you need to copy one of the existing modes. Then when you have named the files according to your mode's name, modify the name of the data in your mode's files. When your mode is ready, add it in modes.cpp and recompile, it should be available in the game now.
