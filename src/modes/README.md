# Modes

Each mode is defined with by its own .cpp and .h file.

To add a new mode, you need to copy the .cpp and .h files from one of the existing modes.
Then, when you have renamed the files according to your mode's name, modify the name of the variables in your mode's files. Now you can modify the modeâ€™s values to suit your needs.
When your mode is ready, add it in modes.cpp and recompile, it should now be available in the game.
